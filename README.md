## Overview

Use `Synapse` to control the `Chroma` app priority. The `topmost` entry will take priority when multiple `Chroma` sessions are active.

The application keeps an icon in the system tray with a context menu to either `show` or `quit` the application.

When `Launch at Startup` is checked, the application will launch when the user logs into Windows.

When `Connect to Discord Events` is checked, `Chroma` animations will play when `Discord` events are detected. The `Discord App` will prompt for authentication when checked for the first time.
